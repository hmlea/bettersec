# Installation

KeePassXC is a graphical user interface program that can be downloaded directly from their website [here](https://keepassxc.org/download).

Once downloaded, you can create your database and add your passwords and information. KeePassXC has a ton of unique and beneficial features that help keep your data secure; you can read more about it on their *Getting Started* guide [here](https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted).

## Other KeePass Forks?

Anyone who has done any searching on KeePassXC or password managers in general have likely seen what seems like hundreds of different version of KeePass; these include the original KeePass, KeePassX, KeePassXC, and plenty more. What's the difference?

All these programs stemmed from the original [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) created in 2003. KeePass was originally built to run solely on Windows and as a result, was "forked" multiple times by other developers to address some of its shortcomings.

There are tons of forks of the original KeePass that have been develeoped over the years; however, KeePassXC is advantageous over others due to its extensive cross platform support, large-scale community support and development, and exceptional performance/ease of use. Read more about why KeePassXC in their FAQ [here](https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-keepassx).

## KeePassXC on iOS

While KeePassXC does not have an official iOS application, there are plenty of similar applications that allow you to view and integrate your database. One particularly noteworthy application used by many (including me) is [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com/). Their iOS application has a free version which allows you to access and integrate your KeePassXC database on your device.

Similar to KeePassXC, Strongbox is open-source and self-hosted; this comes with many of the same benefits that make KeePassXC remarkable.

To transfer your database from your computer to your iOS device, you can import from Google Drive, Airdrop, Dropbox, etc. The easiest and one of the most secure ways is via Airdrop. By Airdropping your database to your device, you bypass hosting it on any *cloud* services where it becomes more vulnerable to third party attacks. Once loaded into Strongbox, you can access all the same information available in KeePassXC as well as integrate it directly into your browser.
