# Better Security

**[Site Link](https://hmlea.github.io/bettersec/)**

This site was made for family to suggest better security practices when storing and sharing passwords and sensitive information. It includes tidbits on:
- GPG and public key cryptography,
- KeePassXC and password managers, and
- The importance of good security practices when sharing passwords and sensitive information.

## In the Future...

I would like to include:
- How to effectively use the command line
- Sources and equations for password strength/statistics
- A guide on browser security/hardening with the [Arkenfox user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js)
- How to securely self-host your own remote storage using a Raspberry Pi
